- 👋 Hi, I’m Suma Marri!
- 👀 I’m interested in watching movies and shows other than English. (Telugu, Tamil, Korean, you name it, I will definitely watch it!) I also love getting random sets of data and playing around with it on Excel, it is so satisfying to clean and organize data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics. I am doing my masters in Data Analytics at UCF. I am also completing a bootcamp with Columbia Engineering, too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a volunteer project that will use my data analytics skills.
